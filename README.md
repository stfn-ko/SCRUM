## <a name="sprint-1-review"></a> ⭐ Sprint reveiw:
* Look more at specification. 
* Pretty good timing with project and workload, however, not enough presentation planning. 
* Should do more presentation preparation. 
* Overall good performance. 
* Code is scalable and readable, needs commenting though.
